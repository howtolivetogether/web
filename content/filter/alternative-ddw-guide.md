The discovery is the most recent in a long line of research that has discovered that animals not native to our planet can talk to us. In a series of studies reported in Scientific American, scientists have discovered that elephants can learn, and have even expressed an admiration for human language in the wild. Some of the most notable include a rare sighting of a gorilla who learned to speak English while on safari in Africa in the 1960s. Many of the discoveries have occurred in the last 10 years.
